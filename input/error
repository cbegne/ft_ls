The lstat() and stat() system calls will fail if:

[EACCES] Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.

[EFAULT] Sb or name points to an invalid address.

[EIO] An I/O error occurs while reading from or writing to the file system.

[ELOOP] Too many symbolic links are encountered in translating
the pathname.  This is taken to be indicative of a loop-
ing symbolic link.

[ENAMETOOLONG] A component of a pathname exceeds {NAME_MAX} characters,
or an entire path name exceeds {PATH_MAX} characters.

[ENOENT] The named file does not exist.

[ENOTDIR] A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

The fstat(), lstat(), and stat() system calls will fail if:

[EOVERFLOW] The file size in bytes or the number of blocks allocated
to the file or the file serial number cannot be repre-
sented correctly in the structure pointed to by buf.

In addition to the errors returned by the stat() and lstat(), fstatat() may
fail if:

[EBADF] The path argument does not specify an absolute path and
the fd argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
descriptor open for searching.

[EINVAL] The value of the flag argument is not valid.

[ENOTDIR] The path argument is not an absolute path and fd is nei-
ther AT_FDCWD nor a file descriptor associated with a
directory.
